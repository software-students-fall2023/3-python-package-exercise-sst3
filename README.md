# Python Package Exercise

A little exercise to create a Python package, build it, test it, distribute it, and use it. See [instructions](./instructions.md) for details.

Please have python3 3.12.0 installed
install pipenv through pip3 install pipenv
install build through python3 -m pip install --upgrade build
install twine through pip3 install twine

if we want to install dependencies we do can pipenv install dependencieName

to open the virtual env do pipenv shell <- if everythin has been set up correctly this should work

to make sure we all have the same dependencies, if we do end up installing any, we should do pipenv install --ignore-pipfile any time there is a new one added
