# Python Package Exercise

A little exercise to create a Python package, build it, test it, distribute it, and use it. See [instructions](./instructions.md) for details.

Please have python3 3.12.0 installed
install pipenv through pip install pipenv

if we want to install dependencies we do can pipenv install dependencieName

to open the virtual env do pipenv shell <- if everythin has been set up correctly this should work

to make sure we all have the same dependencies, if we do end up installing any, we should do pipenv install --ignore-pipfile any time there is a new one added
