a max value which will be the upper bound of what you will have to guess. If you do not want to pass in any arguments the default
will be from 0-100 inclusive.

To access the numberGuess function please do `numberGuess.numberGuess(minValue, maxValue)`

[Example](https://github.com/software-students-fall2023/3-python-package-exercise-sst3/blob/19f463a3b9d2367eb3b02f2373b2896d53064654/example.py#L13)
